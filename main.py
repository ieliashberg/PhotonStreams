# This is a sample Python script.

# Press ⌃R to execute it or replace it with your code.
# Press Double ⇧ to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings.


# Ideas for Naive Python Implementation
# have a step size (variable from 1 to 1000)
# have an array of size 1000 that holds the current samples (and potentially
#    one computed ahead array so you aren't behind by more than 1000 samples (or whatever the step size is)
# Assuming you now have 2 arrays, compute correlation function

def print_hi(name):
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    print(f'Hi, {name}')  # Press ⌘F8 to toggle the breakpoint.




# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
